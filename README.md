## ðŸš€ Introduction

**[AppControl](https://appcontrol.xcomponent.com)** is a modern, lightweight monitoring solution designed specifically for businesses that want to keep their applications running smoothly with minimal downtime. Traditional monitoring tools focus on infrastructure, but **[AppControl](https://appcontrol.xcomponent.com)** takes a different approach: we follow **your applications**, which are the heart of your business.

AppControl works seamlessly with both legacy and cloud-native applications, offering powerful monitoring and control capabilities without the complexity of traditional solutions.

**[Try AppControl Now](https://appcontrol.xcomponent.com)** and see how it can simplify your application monitoring.

## ðŸŒŸ Why AppControl?

Traditional monitoring tools like Centreon, Zabbix, and Nagios have long been used to track infrastructure metrics, but they often feel outdated, bloated, or too complex for modern cloud environments. They were built at a time when monolithic applications ran on a handful of servers. Today, applications are highly distributed, built on microservices, and hosted in hybrid environments.

**AppControl** offers a fresh approach:

-   **Application-Centric Monitoring**: Instead of focusing only on servers or infrastructure, AppControl monitors the components of your applications, whether they're cloud-native or legacy.
-   **Simple and Scalable**: Built to be simple for small to medium-sized businesses, but scalable to handle more complex architectures.
-   **Re-use Your Existing Scripts**: If youâ€™re using Centreon, Zabbix, or other APMs, you can re-use your existing monitoring scripts and checks within AppControl. No need to start from scratch.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

-   **Unified Dashboard**: Monitor the status of your applications in real-time with clear indicators: running, stopped, degraded, or in error.
-   **History & Logs**: Access a comprehensive history of actions taken, incidents, and resolutions.
-   **Automation**: Use built-in tools to automate recovery actions and reduce manual intervention.
-   **Custom Actions**: Perform on-demand diagnostic actions for deeper insight into issues as they arise.
-   **Notifications**: Get alerted instantly via SMS or Microsoft Teams when incidents occur.
-   **Extensibility**: Add custom scripts or monitoring checksâ€”perfect for teams transitioning from other monitoring platforms.

## ðŸ’¡ Use Cases

1. **Critical Business Applications**: Ensure your CRM, ERP, or any other critical application stays available and operational, no matter the environment. AppControlâ€™s monitoring and automation ensure quick recovery from unexpected failures.
2. **Hybrid Cloud Applications**: Whether your applications are in the cloud, on-prem, or a mix of both, AppControl provides a unified view of your application status and components, automatically managing dependencies between services.

3. **Legacy Infrastructure Modernization**: If you're modernizing your infrastructure or transitioning to the cloud, AppControl allows you to maintain control over both new and old systems, re-using your legacy scripts without modification.

## ðŸ’» Getting Started

AppControl is available as a SaaS platform, and getting started is simple. You can start monitoring your applications in just a few minutes:

1. **Sign up for AppControl** and deploy agents in your infrastructure (Windows/Linux). The agents are lightweight and resource-efficient.
2. Use our **YAML-based configuration files** to describe your applications and components.
3. Optionally, use your existing monitoring scripts from other tools like Centreon or Zabbix within AppControl for additional checks.
4. View the status of your applications via our intuitive dashboard.

For detailed instructions on how to deploy agents, configure applications, or use custom scripts, check out our [documentation](https://xcomponent.github.io/appcontrol-documentation/).

## ðŸ›  How It Works

AppControl is designed to be cross-platform and flexible:

-   **Agents**: Lightweight agents running on Windows or Linux collect and report status back to AppControl's SaaS platform.
-   **Gateway**: A secure gateway serves as the link between your local infrastructure and our cloud service, ensuring smooth communication.
-   **Applications & Components**: Use YAML files to define your application's structure and dependencies, ensuring that AppControl knows exactly how to start, stop, and monitor each part of your system.
-   **Actionable Insights**: On-demand actions let you perform diagnostics, while automated recovery processes help prevent downtime.
