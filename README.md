## OBJECTIVES

- Find root cause with no human intervention
- Eliminate human error when restarting
- Keep operational procedures tested and up-to-date

AppControl allows you to both monitor the status of applications in real time but **above all to act** when an incident occurs.
Where monitoring software signals you problems, AppControl offers to correct them.

## HOW IT WORKS

In AppControl, an application is a hierarchy of components. <br> A component have several commands:

- A check command to retrieve the current state
- A start command
- A stop command
- And some optionals custom commands

- #### Dependencies behaviour
- A component can only starts if its parent's components are started.
- A component can only stops if its children's components are stopped.

#### Diagnostic

In this situation, there are 2 issues:

- 2 components are stopped whereas there parents are started

--> AppControl has detected the issues.

#### Resolution

1. AppControl stops orphans components

   ![Resolution1](images/resolution1.png)

2. Healthy situation, we are ready to restore the services

   ![Resolution2](images/resolution2.png)

3. Restart by branch

4. Normal situation

## Q/A

1. Does AppControl replace the monitoring tools (Nagios, Centreon, Zabbix, ...) ?

   No, AppControl is not intended to replace these tools. It is possible to rely on these probes and add additional action commands.
